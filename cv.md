About Me
I have been working in EPAM Systems since 2016. I am a Senior Software Testing Engineer. Currently I am on Maternity leave. Before that my work included automation testing, I interacted a lot with developers, I am familiar with their work and it seems to me very interesting. I had time to think and I decided to become a software developer. So, after Maternity leave I want to return in EPAM and work as a developer.


Навыки (языки программирования, фреймворки, методологии, системы контроля версий и инструменты разработки, которыми вы владеете)
Skills
My skills mostly include functional and automation testing skills.
But now I am learning and trying to focus and expand my knowledge in:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Git
Jest 


Code example

const fillArray = (start, end) => {
  let newArray = [];

  if (start <= end) {
    for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
      newArray.push(i);
    }
  } else if (start > end) {
    for (let i = start; i >= end; i--) {
      newArray.push(i);
    }
  } else {
    throw "Start or End point are undefined or NaN";
  }

  return newArray;
};

fillArray(1,5)  //[1,2,3,4,5]

I worked on two foreign projects in Epam, where I need to use English. 
On the first project I worked only for a few months. The team was from the Czech Republic, so we had to interact in English.
The second project was more interesting. I worked on it for almost a year and a half. Part of the customer's team was based in London, UK. So English communication was on a daily basis, including daily stand-ups, communication with PM, analyst, developer and other people. During this period I was lucky to visit London, to live and work there for a couple of weeks during the business trip.
